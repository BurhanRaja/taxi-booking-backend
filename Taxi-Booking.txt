Designing a database schema for an Uber-like booking app involves considering various entities and their relationships. Here's an example of a database schema for an Uber-like booking app:

User
user_id (primary key)
name
phone_number
email
password
address

Driver
driver_id (primary key)
name
phone_number
email
password
car_model
car_license_plate
current_location

Rider
rider_id (primary key)
user_id (foreign key referencing User.user_id)

Ride
ride_id (primary key)
driver_id (foreign key referencing Driver.driver_id)
rider_id (foreign key referencing Rider.rider_id)
pickup_location
dropoff_location
pickup_time
dropoff_time
fare_amount
payment_status

Payment
payment_id (primary key)
rider_id (foreign key referencing Rider.rider_id)
ride_id (foreign key referencing Ride.ride_id)
payment_date
payment_amount

Car
car_id (primary key)
driver_id (foreign key referencing Driver.driver_id)
car_model
car_license_plate

In this schema, we have several tables:

The User table stores common user information, including both drivers and riders. It contains attributes such as user_id, name, phone_number, email, password, and address.

The Driver table represents driver-specific information, including driver_id, car_model, car_license_plate, and current_location. It also includes attributes inherited from the User table.

The Rider table represents rider-specific information, including rider_id and default_payment_method. It also includes attributes inherited from the User table.

The Ride table stores details about each ride, including ride_id, driver_id, rider_id, pickup_location, dropoff_location, pickup_time, dropoff_time, fare_amount, and payment_status. It establishes relationships between drivers and riders through foreign keys.

The Payment table stores payment-related information, including payment_id, rider_id, ride_id, payment_date, and payment_amount. It establishes relationships between riders and rides through foreign keys.

The Car table stores information about the cars associated with each driver. It includes car_id, driver_id, car_model, and car_license_plate. It establishes a relationship between drivers and their cars through a foreign key.

This schema provides a foundation for managing user accounts, driver information, rider information, ride details, and payment records in an Uber-like booking app.
